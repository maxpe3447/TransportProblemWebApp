# TransoprtProblem Web Application
## Powered by  [![N|Solid](https://github.com/maxpe3447/TransportProblemWebApp/blob/master/doc/Images/asp.png?raw=true)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet)
[//]:<!--[![Build Status]()](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)-->

## The project uses such a technology stack:

-  [Asp.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/) - is a free web framework for building great websites and web applications
-  [Razor Pages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-7.0) - is a newer, simplified web application programming model.
-  [EntityFramework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/) -  is a modern object-relation mapper that lets you build a clean, portable, and high-level data access layer with .NET (C#) 
-  [Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-7.0) -is an API that supports user interface (UI) login functionality.
-  HTML + CSS

### Patterns
- MVC
- Dependency Injection

## Tests
- MSTest Framevork

# Algorithms
- Double preference
- Minimal element
- Nord west
- Vogel approximation
- Floyd Warshall
- Optimization method potentials

## New
- New algorithm: Genetic algorithm

> The genetic algorithm is a method for solving both constrained and 
unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, 
the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions.



## Using
On the main page of the website you can enter the matrix of transport prices as well as the value of customers and suppliers.
